## About

Hello in our little app. It was created as part of learning JavaScript programming using the
Express and Vue frameworks and with the use of MongoDB.
The application allows you to search for books in the API
https://openlibrary.org/ and in our Data Base. It is also possible to register the
user and log in, while using the application, the Client is authenticated using the
Json Web Token and can add his favorite books.
the application also has an administrator panel, also with authentication,
a person with administrator rights can:
- Delete users
